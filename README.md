# Student-Test-Scores-Excel
📚 Student Test Scores Analysis (Excel-Based)
This project uses Microsoft Excel to analyse and visualize student test performance across multiple subjects. It involves cleaning raw score data, computing average performance, and investigating how lifestyle factors—like part-time jobs, extracurricular activities, and self-study habits—affect academic outcomes.

# 📊 Project Overview
The aim of this analysis is to uncover trends and correlations between students' academic performance and various influencing factors using Excel’s powerful built-in tools. The dataset includes individual subject scores, attendance records, and additional lifestyle-related attributes.

# Key Steps:
Data cleaning and formatting

Calculating average test scores across subjects

Creating a bell curve (normal distribution) chart of average scores

Comparing average scores across different groups (e.g., part-time job vs. no job)

Analyzing relationships between performance and:

Extracurricular activities

Weekly self-study hours

Number of absence days

Part-time work status

# 🔧 Tools Used
Microsoft Excel

Functions: AVERAGE(), IF(), COUNTIF(), STDEV.S(), etc.

Data validation and formatting

Chart: Bell Curve
